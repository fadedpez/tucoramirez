When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk.
There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who have a rope around their neck and those who have the job of doing the cutting.
You want to know who you are? Huh? Huh? You don't, I do, everyone does... you're the son of a thousand fathers, all bastards like you.
If you work for a living, why do you kill yourself working?
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend. Those that come in by the door, those that come in by the window.
Cervesa!
