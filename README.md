## Architecture

1. Entities Layer (Core)
   - Pure data structures (Game, Card, Hand, Player, Wallet)
   - No business logic
   - Used across all layers
   - Defines core types and states

2. Repository Layer
   - Implements data persistence and retrieval
   - Thread-safe in-memory storage
   - SQLite implementation for persistent storage
   - Database migration system for schema evolution
   - One repository per entity type
   - Clean interfaces for data access

3. Service Layer
   - Uses repositories to manage game state
   - Implements game operations (hit, stand)
   - Coordinates between repositories and presentation
   - Contains blackjack rules and logic
   - Image service for game completion images
   - Wallet service for currency management

4. Discord Layer (Presentation)
   - Handles all Discord-specific logic
   - Single command with button interactions
   - Uses service layer for game operations
   - No direct access to repositories

## Wallet System

The bot includes a comprehensive wallet system that allows players to manage their in-game currency.

### Wallet Features

- **Balance Management**: Players can view their current balance
- **Loan System**: Players can take loans to increase their balance
- **Repayment System**: Players can repay their loans
- **Transaction History**: All currency movements are recorded as transactions

### Wallet Entity

```go
type Wallet struct {
    UserID      string
    Balance     int64
    LoanAmount  int64
    LastUpdated time.Time
}

type Transaction struct {
    ID           string
    UserID       string
    Amount       int64
    Type         TransactionType
    Description  string
    Timestamp    time.Time
    BalanceAfter int64
}

type TransactionType string

const (
    TransactionTypeLoan      TransactionType = "loan"
    TransactionTypeRepayment TransactionType = "repayment"
    TransactionTypeBet       TransactionType = "bet"
    TransactionTypeWin       TransactionType = "win"
    TransactionTypeRefund    TransactionType = "refund"
)
```

### Wallet Service

The wallet service provides the following operations:

- **GetOrCreateWallet**: Retrieves a user's wallet or creates one if it doesn't exist
- **AddFunds**: Adds funds to a user's wallet
- **RemoveFunds**: Removes funds from a user's wallet if sufficient funds exist
- **TakeLoan**: Adds a loan amount to the user's wallet
- **RepayLoan**: Repays a portion of the user's loan

### Integration with Games

The wallet system integrates with the blackjack game to:

1. **Place Bets**: When a player starts a game, funds are removed from their wallet
2. **Award Winnings**: When a player wins, funds are added to their wallet
3. **Refund Bets**: In certain game scenarios, bets may be refunded to the wallet

Players can use the `/wallet` command to view their balance and manage loans.

## Gameplay Features

### Blackjack

#### Turn-Based Player Actions
The blackjack game implements a turn-based system for player actions:

- Players take turns in the order they joined the game
- A pointing finger emoji (ðŸ‘‰) indicates whose turn it is currently
- Only the current player can take actions (hit/stand)
- Players who try to act out of turn receive a friendly message
- The turn automatically advances after a player stands or busts
- Once all players have completed their turns, the dealer plays according to house rules
- The `PlayerOrder` slice maintains consistent player ordering for both turns and UI display

This system ensures fair gameplay while maintaining the social dynamics of a card game. The visual indicator makes it clear whose turn it is without cluttering the interface.

```go
// Example of turn management in the Game struct
type Game struct {
    // ... other fields
    PlayerOrder []string // Ordered list of player IDs
    CurrentTurn int      // Index into PlayerOrder
}

// IsPlayerTurn checks if it's the specified player's turn
func (g *Game) IsPlayerTurn(playerID string) bool {
    currentPlayer, err := g.GetCurrentTurnPlayerID()
    if err != nil {
        return false
    }
    return playerID == currentPlayer
}

// In UI creation, use PlayerOrder for consistent display
// Instead of: for playerID, hand := range game.Players { ... }
// Use: for _, playerID := range game.PlayerOrder { hand := game.Players[playerID]; ... }
```

### Discord Layer

```go
func NewBot(token string, repository game.Repository) (*Bot, error) {
    // Create Discord session
    session, err := discordgo.New("Bot " + token)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to create Discord session: %w", err)
    }
    
    // Initialize image service
    imageService, err := image.NewService("images.txt")
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("error initializing image service: %w", err)
    }
    
    bot := &Bot{
        session:      session,
        token:        token,
        games:        make(map[string]*blackjack.Game),
        lobbies:      make(map[string]*GameLobby),
        repo:         repository,
        imageService: imageService,
    }
    
    // Register handlers
    bot.registerHandlers()
    
    return bot, nil
}
```

## Recent Refactoring (March 2025)

### Wallet Integration with Blackjack Payouts

We recently refactored the payout system in the Blackjack game to improve the separation of concerns between the service layer and the Discord handler layer.

#### Changes Made

1. **Service Layer Responsibility**
   - Moved wallet management logic from the Discord handler to the game service layer
   - Created a `GetPlayerWallets` method in the Game struct to encapsulate wallet collection logic
   - Added a `CompleteGameWithPayouts` method to handle game completion and payout processing in one place

2. **Improved Separation of Concerns**
   - Discord handlers now only call service methods and display results
   - All wallet operations (checking balances, processing payouts) happen in the service layer
   - Removed direct wallet manipulation from the Discord layer

3. **Test Improvements**
   - Fixed the `MockWalletService` implementation by adding missing methods
   - Re-enabled previously disabled tests for payout processing

#### Architecture Decisions

The refactoring follows these key principles:

1. **Clean Separation**
   - Game logic (including payouts) belongs in the service layer
   - Discord layer only handles UI and user interaction

2. **Minimal Changes**
   - Made targeted changes only where needed
   - Preserved existing code structure and patterns

3. **Automatic Payout Processing**
   - Payouts are now processed automatically when a game transitions to the complete state
   - This ensures consistent behavior regardless of how the game ends

```go
// Example of the new CompleteGameWithPayouts method
func (g *Game) CompleteGameWithPayouts(ctx context.Context, walletService WalletService) error {
    // Ensure the game is in complete state
    if g.State != entities.StateComplete {
        g.State = entities.StateComplete
    }

    // Process payouts if they haven't been processed yet
    if !g.PayoutsProcessed {
        log.Printf("Processing payouts for completed game in channel %s", g.ChannelID)
        return g.ProcessPayoutsWithWalletUpdates(ctx, walletService)
    }

    return nil
}
```

This approach ensures that the game service maintains full control over the game state and payout processing, while the Discord layer focuses solely on user interaction and display.

## Next Steps

### Player Statistics Feature with Elasticsearch Integration

We're implementing a comprehensive player statistics system with the following components:

#### 1. Data Architecture

- **Primary Storage**: SQLite for transactional game data
- **Analytics Engine**: Elasticsearch for statistics aggregation and historical data
- **Data Flow**: Game results saved to SQLite â†’ indexed in Elasticsearch â†’ queried for statistics

#### 2. Implementation Components

##### Database Schema
- New `player_statistics` table in SQLite for cached statistics
- Elasticsearch indices for game results with nested player data
- Index lifecycle management for automatic data retention

##### Repository Layer
- Extended game repository interface with statistics methods
- Elasticsearch client integration for indexing and querying
- Game result archiving with JSON export for backup

##### Service Layer
- New statistics service for aggregating player performance
- Top performer calculation with crown emoji indicators
- Pagination support for statistics display

##### Discord Commands
- New `/stats` command with pagination controls
- Toggle between core stats and special stats views
- Sorting options for different statistics categories

#### 3. Statistics Categories

##### Core Statistics
- Games played, wins, losses, pushes
- Total bet, total winnings, net profit
- Win rate percentage

##### Special Statistics (Blackjack)
- Blackjacks achieved
- Busts count
- Special bets usage (splits, double downs, insurance)

#### 4. User Interface

- Paginated display with navigation buttons
- Crown emoji indicators for top performers
- Clean tabular format for easy reading
- Toggle buttons for different statistic views

#### 5. Data Management

- Game results stored indefinitely in Elasticsearch
- Automatic index rotation based on time periods
- Efficient aggregation queries for real-time statistics

This approach provides a scalable solution for player statistics while maintaining high performance and data integrity across the application.
